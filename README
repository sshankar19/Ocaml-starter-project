This project provides an introduction to OCaml programming and some
warm-up exercises involving tree manipulation and recursive
programming (both of which will be highly useful when building the
compiler). It will also familiarize you with the basic workflow of the
projects in this course, including the testing framework that we will
use to (partially) automate the grading of your projects.

(1) Assignment submission

Most of the instructions for this project are found as comments in the
source files. For this project, you should primarily fill the
hellocaml.ml and submit your directory as project1.tar.gz directory. 

When we execute the following set of commands on a linux box, your
submission should execute the tests. If you create the tar file in the
wrong fashion, it may not have the correct directory structure.

tar -zxvf project1.tar.gz
cd project1
./ocamlbuild main.native
./main.native --test


Instructions for creating the tar file. Lets say all your project1 materials are in the project1 directory

#ls
project1

#tar -c project1 > project1.tar

#gzip project1.tar

The last command should create project1.tar.gz

(2) Grading
 
You will get no credit if your submitted program does not compile.
Apart from the test already given, we will run some hidden tests. Your
points will be 65% for passing the given tests (with correctly written
code) and 35% for the hidden tests.
